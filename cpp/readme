Run ./driver.sh n to search for quasi-Williamson sequences of length n.

Warning: The code was adapted from a search for Williamson sequences and not all
aspects were adapted to the quasi-Williamson case.  For example, the set of
rowsum decompositions will not be exhaustive for the quasi-Williamson case.
The quasi-Williamson equivalence check should also be updated.
