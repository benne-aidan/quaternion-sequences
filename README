# Description

This repository will contain various approaches and algorithms to find specific quaternion sequences
The python folder contains python code, and the rust folder contains rust code.


## In the rust folder:
### The results folder contains all the data generated by the code.

TODO: detail the different types of files

The Quaternion and Williamson sequences are stocked in the following format:
each line contains a sequence, and each element correspond to a character:
1       -> +
-1      -> -
i       -> i
j       -> j
k       -> k
q       -> q
q*i     -> x
q*j     -> y
q*k     -> z

### The src folder contains all of the code 

The main details what part of the code is running. You can change that by changing which function of the file it is running.
You can run the code with the command 'cargo run'

The find folder contains the code that finds and generates specific sequences

the sequences folder contains the code for the classes related to Quaternion or Williamson sequences.

The test folder contains tests of various parts of the code.
You can run the tests with the command 'cargo test'
